This is a Windows Batch Script designed to simplify the connection and launch of the scrcpy screen mirroring tool, primarily focusing on automated Wi-Fi connections.

✨ Features
Automated Connection: Easily connect your Android device using ADB.

Three Connection Modes:

Saved Wi-Fi IP Connect: Attempts to connect using the IP address previously saved in lastip.txt.

USB Connect: Connects the device using a direct USB cable connection (scrcpy -d).

New Wi-Fi IP: Prompts the user to enter a new IP address, saves it to lastip.txt, and establishes the connection.

Optimized Launch: Launches scrcpy with optimized settings: --video-codec=h264 --max-size=1080.

Persistent Navigation: Uses simple numerical input prompts (1/0) for navigation, allowing quick re-connections or changes between connection modes.

⚙️ How It Works
The script checks for a saved IP in the lastip.txt file.

It prompts the user to choose between using the Saved IP or starting a USB connection.

For Wi-Fi connections, it uses ADB (Android Debug Bridge) to:

Set the device to listen on port 5555 (adb tcpip 5555).

Connect to the specified IP address (adb connect [IP]:5555).

Finally, it executes the scrcpy command with the appropriate connection flag (-s [IP]:5555 or -d for USB).

🚀 Requirements
Windows OS (This is a Batch Script).

Android Debug Bridge (ADB) installed and accessible via your system's PATH.

scrcpy installed and accessible via your system's PATH.
