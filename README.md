# scrcpy Connection Manager
A simple yet powerful Windows Batch Script designed to simplify connecting and launching of [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy); the powerful Android screen mirroring tool. This manager improves ease of usage for auto connection handling, multiple IP management, and extensive troubleshooting capabilities.
Hopefully will be able to merge this with the original but till then it matures here.

## ✨ Key Features
### 🔌 Smart Connection Management
- **Multiple IP Storage**: Save and manage multiple device IP addresses
- **Automatic Connection**: Attempts all saved IPs automatically on startup
- **Smart Prioritization**: Most recently used/successful IPs are tried first
- **Skip Auto-Connect**: Optional manual control over connection attempts
- **Three Connection Modes**:
  - **Saved Wi-Fi IP**: Connect using stored IP addresses
  - **USB Cable**: Direct connection via USB (scrcpy -d)
  - **New IP Setup**: Add and immediately connect to new devices

### 🛠️ Advanced IP Management
- **Multi-IP Support**: Store unlimited device IP addresses
- **Add/Remove IPs**: Easy management interface with confirmation prompts
- **Duplicate Detection**: Prevents saving the same IP twice
- **Auto-Reordering**: Successfully connected IPs move to top priority
- **IP Validation**: Basic format checking before saving

### 🔧 Robust Error Handling & Recovery
- **Automatic Troubleshooting**: 
  - Direct connection attempt
  - ADB server restart
  - TCP/IP mode setup
  - USB fallback option
- **Tool Verification**: Checks for ADB and scrcpy availability
- **USB Device Detection**: Validates device connection and authorization
- **Network Diagnostics**: Step-by-step guidance for connection issues
- **Multiple Retry Options**: Never get stuck - always have a way forward

### 💡 Enhanced User Experience
- **Welcome Screen**: Clear program explanation on startup
- **Intuitive Prompts**: Plain language instead of cryptic codes
- **Flexible Input**: Accepts Y/N, Yes/No, or 1/0
- **Session Management**: Quick reconnect after disconnection
- **Professional Formatting**: Clean interface with section dividers
- **Portable**: Uses current directory - works from any location

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Startup Check**: Looks for `lastip.txt` with saved IP addresses
2. **Auto-Connect Option**: Asks if you want to automatically try all saved IPs
3. **Connection Attempts**: Tries each IP in order (most recent first)
4. **On Success**: Launches scrcpy with optimized settings
5. **On Failure**: Offers troubleshooting, manual selection, USB fallback, or new IP setup
6. **Session End**: Provides quick reconnect options

### Connection Flow
- **Direct Connection**: Attempts `adb connect [IP]:5555` immediately
- **ADB Restart**: If failed, restarts ADB server and retries
- **TCP/IP Setup**: Falls back to `adb tcpip 5555` with USB-connected device
- **USB Mode**: Direct USB connection as final fallback

### Optimized scrcpy Launch
All connections use optimized settings:
- `--video-codec=h264`: Hardware-accelerated encoding
- `--max-size=1080`: 1080p resolution for balance of quality and performance

## 🚀 Requirements
- **Windows OS** (Batch Script)
- **Android Debug Bridge (ADB)** installed and in system PATH
  - Download: [Android SDK Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)
- **scrcpy** installed and in system PATH
  - Download: [scrcpy releases](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/releases)
- **Android Device** with USB debugging enabled

## 📋 Setup Instructions

1. **Install Requirements**:
   - Install ADB (Android SDK Platform Tools)
   - Install scrcpy
   - Add both to your system PATH

2. **Download Script**:
   - Save `scrcpy_manager.bat` to any folder
   - (Optional) Create desktop shortcut for quick access

3. **First Run**:
   - Connect your Android device via USB
   - Run the script
   - Enable USB debugging on your device when prompted
   - Follow on-screen instructions to set up Wi-Fi connection

4. **Subsequent Runs**:
   - Script will automatically attempt saved IPs
   - Or choose manual mode for more control

## 🎮 Usage Guide

### Main Menu Options
- **1** - Auto-try all saved IPs
- **2** - Select specific IP to connect
- **3** - Add new IP address
- **4** - Manage saved IPs (view/remove)
- **5** - Try USB connection
- **0** - Exit program

### After Connection Ends
- **1** - Reconnect with same IP/USB
- **2** - Try all saved IPs again / Try wireless
- **3** - Select different saved IP
- **4** - Add new IP address (wireless only)
- **0** - Exit program

### Tips
- Press **1** or **Y** at startup to auto-try all IPs
- Press **0** or **N** for manual control
- Selected IPs automatically move to top priority
- USB connection works as emergency fallback

## 📁 Files Created

- `lastip.txt`: Stores all saved IP addresses (one per line, most recent first)
- `temp_ips.txt`: Temporary file used during IP reordering (auto-deleted)

Both files are created in the same directory as the script.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "ADB not found in PATH"
- Ensure Android SDK Platform Tools are installed
- Add ADB directory to Windows PATH environment variable
- Restart command prompt after PATH changes

### "scrcpy not found in PATH"
- Download and extract scrcpy
- Add scrcpy directory to Windows PATH
- Verify by running `scrcpy --version` in command prompt

### "No USB devices found"
- Check USB cable (must support data transfer)
- Enable USB debugging in Developer Options
- Authorize computer on device when prompted
- Try different USB port

### Connection Fails
- Ensure device and computer on same Wi-Fi network
- Check if wireless debugging is enabled on device
- Verify IP address is correct (Settings → About Phone → Status)
- Try the built-in troubleshooting options (restarts ADB automatically)

### Device Not Authorized
- Check device screen for authorization prompt
- Accept "Allow USB debugging" dialog
- Check "Always allow from this computer" for convenience

## 🔄 Update History

### v3.4 - Smart IP Ordering (Current)
- **Selected IP moves to top of list** - "Most Recently Used" ordering
- When user manually selects an IP, it moves to position #1
- Successfully connected IPs automatically move to top
- New IPs added at top of list (highest priority)
- Next auto-try prioritizes most recently used IPs first
- Added `:moveiptotop` subroutine for IP reordering
- Improved duplicate IP handling - moves existing IP to top instead of error

### v3.3 - Skip Auto-Connect
- **Option to skip automatic IP trying** at startup
